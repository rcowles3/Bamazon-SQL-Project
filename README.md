# Bamazon-SQL-Project
Application is an Amazon like store front, the app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. The app will also track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.

Due to the application running off of a local database, there is a short video detailing all of the applications functionality in the root of the repo, *bamazonWalkthrough.mov*.

As well, video can be seen on YouTube: [Bamazon SQL Project](https://youtu.be/hABJdMb7dXM)

Although, should the user wish to run the application locally, the database used to run the app is provided, *MOCK_DATA.csv*.
