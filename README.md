# Bamazon-SQL-Project
Application is an Amazon like store front, the app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. The app will also track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.

## Getting Started

Due to the application running off of a local database, there is a short video detailing all of the applications functionality in the root of the repo, *bamazonWalkthrough.mov*.

As well, video can be seen on YouTube: [Bamazon SQL Project](https://youtu.be/hABJdMb7dXM)

### Installing

In order to get a development env running, there is a database, *MOCK_DATA.csv* that you can download, and import into your SQL database.
